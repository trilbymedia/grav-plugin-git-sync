# Git

Simple PHP wrapper for Git.

## Installation

To add this package as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `sebastian/git` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on Git 1.0:

    {
        "require": {
            "sebastian/git": "1.0.*"
        }
    }
