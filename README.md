**Git Sync** is a Plugin for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) that allows to seamlessly synchronize a Git repository with your Grav site, and vice-versa. 

Git Sync captures any change that you make on your site and instantly updates your git repository. In the same way, Git Sync supports _webhooks_, allowing to automatically synchronize your site if the repository changes.

Thanks to this powerful bi-directional flow, Git Sync can now turn your site into a collaborative environment where the source of truth is always your git repository and unlimited collaborators and sites can share and contribute to the same content.

# Command Line Interface

Git Sync comes with a CLI that allows to run synchronizations right within your terminal. This feature is extremely useful in case you'd like to run an autonomous periodic crontab job to synchronize with your repository.

To execute the command simply run:

```bash
bin/plugin git-sync sync
```

# Requirements

In order for the plugin to work, the server needs to run `git` 1.7.1 and above. The PHP exec() function also has to be enabled.
